### Comprehensive Ethics Bundle License and Data Use Agreement

#### FAQ

##### May I use the CEB to share my work?

Yes! You are welcome to use the CEB under the terms outlined in the
[license license](LICENSE_LICENSE.txt).

##### What inspired the CEB?

In past decades, significant advances have been made that facilitate
sharing material so that others may re-use it. People soon realized that
legal frameworks must protect ethical virtues to ensure that shared work
is used according to the wishes of its creators. The General Public
License has pioneered ethical licensing with its copyleft innovation,
requiring derivative work also be shared. Creative Commons expanded
ethical licensing innovations with the introduction of attribution
requirements, non-commercial limitation, and the prevention of derivative
work to protect artistic integrity.

In the realm of science, we recognized data use agreements commonly
stipulate that users may not use the material to violate privacy. More
recently, Cory Doctorow asked us "How about you ban patents based on
what you share?"

We realized there are many important aspects that promote ethical
behavior, and current popular licenses fail to encompass these entirely.
Thus, we strove to include all of them within the scope of a single
comprehensive license and data use agreement. We are confident that
CEB-shared material will be a powerful force for the public good.

##### Is CEB compatible with GPL licenses?

Um... no. No, it is definitely not GPL-compatible.
