### Comprehensive Ethics Bundle License and Data Use Agreement

#### FAQ

##### What is the Comprehensive Ethics Bundle?

The [Comprehensive Ethics Bundle](LICENSE.txt) is a license and data
use agreement that allows you to share your work in a manner that
ensures your work is used ethically. The license combines various
licensing and data use terms to create a comprehensive assurance
that your work will not be misused.

##### May I use the CEB to share my work?

Yes! You are welcome to use the CEB under the terms outlined in the
[license license](LICENSE_LICENSE.txt).

##### What inspired the CEB?

In past decades, significant advances have been made that facilitate
sharing material so that others may re-use it. People soon realized that
legal frameworks must protect ethical virtues to ensure that shared work
is used according to the wishes of its creators. The General Public
License has pioneered ethical licensing with its copyleft innovation,
requiring derivative work also be shared. Creative Commons expanded
ethical licensing innovations with the introduction of attribution
requirements, non-commercial limitation, and the prevention of derivative
work to protect artistic integrity.

In the realm of science, we recognized data use agreements commonly
stipulate that users may not use the material to violate privacy. More
recently, Cory Doctorow asked us "How about you ban patents based on
what you share?" We hadn't thought of that!

We realized there are many important aspects that promote ethical
behavior, and current popular licenses fail to encompass these entirely.
Thus, we strove to include all of them within the scope of a single
comprehensive license and data use agreement. We are confident that
CEB-shared material will be a powerful force for the public good.

##### May I contribute amendments to the CEB text?

Yes, we would love to see improvements to the CEB, we realize
it will be a continuing struggle to achieve ethical perfection. For
this reason, the CEB text is itself shared under the terms outlined in
the [license license](LICENSE_LICENSE.txt). We request you send
suggested improvements to our
[github project](https://github.com/madprime/comprehensive_ethics_bundle)
as pull requests.

Note: introducing or increasing internal inconsitency in the CEB will
be considered a feature, not a bug.

##### Is CEB compatible with GPL licenses?

Um... no. No, it is definitely not GPL-compatible.
